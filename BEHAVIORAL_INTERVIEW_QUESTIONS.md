### Question 2: Innovation & Problem Solving
**"Describe a time when you had to come up with a creative solution to a technical challenge."**

**Sample STAR Response:**
```
Situation: Users were experiencing 3-5 second delays when starting conversations 
due to Lambda cold starts, especially during low-traffic periods.

Task: Reduce response time to under 500ms while keeping costs reasonable.

Action:
- Analyzed usage patterns and identified peak/low traffic times
- Implemented a hybrid approach: provisioned concurrency for core functions 
  during business hours, and a lightweight "warm-up" service that pinged 
  functions every 10 minutes during off-hours
- Optimized Lambda package sizes by removing unused dependencies
- Implemented connection pooling for DynamoDB
- Created a predictive scaling algorithm based on historical usage

Result: Average response time dropped to 300ms, cold start incidents reduced 
by 90%, and costs only increased by 12% due to smart provisioning strategies.
